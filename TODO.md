# TO DO

I probably won't do any of these here - this is just a spike after all - but a real implementation needs these.

* OAuth2 authentication, both so we don't hit API rate limits, and so we can see private repos. See [OAuth2 links](https://pinboard.in/u:brunns/t:oauth2).
* Use py2app as per [Creating macOS Apps from Python Code](https://camillovisini.com/article/create-macos-menu-bar-app-pomodoro/#creating-macos-apps-from-python-code).
* Better structure - much better.
* [CLI options](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html).
* Configurability (including eventually a preferences UI - but a config file will do to start with).
* Deal with multiple workflows per repo.
