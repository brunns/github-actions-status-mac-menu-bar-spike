# TO DO

I won't do any of these here - this is just a spike after all - but a real implementation needs these.

* Use py2app as per [Creating macOS Apps from Python Code](https://camillovisini.com/article/create-macos-menu-bar-app-pomodoro/#creating-macos-apps-from-python-code).
* OAuth2 authentication - see [OAuth2 links](https://pinboard.in/u:brunns/t:oauth2).
* Show running builds.
* Better structure - much better.
* [CLI options](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html).
* Configurability (including eventually a preferences UI - but a config file will do to start with).
